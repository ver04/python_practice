<h3>Dividing a Bill - From Nightmare to Ease!</h3>

<br>

This mini-program helps calculate the tip amount based on a total bill and evenly distributes it among a specified group of people. 

Users input the total bill, percentage of tip and the number of individuals sharing the whole payment. The program then computes an equal share of payment per person.
