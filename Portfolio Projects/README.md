<h1>Portfolio Projects</h1>

In this place would after time be a curated collection of special projects to showcase my Python and Data analysis skills.

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

How to structure your project analysis:

1) Review the data, understand it well.
2) Create & state driving questions.
3) Clean the data and document your process.
4) Create visuals to answer your questions.
5) Clearly explain any insights you have made.
6) Present your suggestions for next steps.
