<h1>Data Analysis in Python</h1>



<b> Welcome to the <i>Python Practice</i> repository! A collection of Data Analysis Exercises and Projects in Jupyter Notebooks. </b>
<br><br>

<h2> About Me </h2>
I am a data analyst in the beginning of my journey. Though with a strong passion for data and programming! I am interested in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. I am constantly learning and growing my collection of created projects, case-studies and mini-practice exercises or code snippets.
<br><br>

<h2> How to use this repository </h2>
To use this repository, you'll need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. If you don't have it installed already, you can download it from the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution">Anaconda</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a> official website.

<br>Once you have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine and open the notebooks in Jupyter. To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:

<code>git clone https://github.com/ver04/python_practice.git</code>

After you've cloned the repository, navigate to the directory where it's stored and open Jupyter Notebook. From there, you can open any of the notebooks in the repository and start exploring

Each notebook contains the source code and explanations of the project, which can help you understand the techniques and concepts used in data analysis and machine learning.

<h2>Contents</h2>
This repository will over time include notebooks on: <br> <br>

<b>1. Basics of Python for Data Analysis</b> :snake:
- this section will cover the basics of the Python programming language that are essential for data analysis. I will cover topics such as variables, data types, functions, loops, and conditionals. 

<b>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b> :mag:
- an essential step in any data analysis project, to gain insights and make informed decisions about your data. In this section, I will cover the different techniques and tools used to explore and understand data - e.g. how to summarize data, detect outliers, visualize distributions, and identify patterns and relationships between variables. 

<b>3. Data Manipulation</b> :hammer_and_wrench:
- in this section, I will cover various techniques and tools for manipulating data, such as filtering, sorting and subsetting. 

<b>4. Data Cleaning</b> :broom:
- techniques for cleaning and preprocessing data, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data (merging, grouping, and pivoting).

<b>5. Data Visualization</b> :bar_chart:
- different types of visualizations for exploring and presenting data, including bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and histograms.

<b>6. Statistical Analysis</b> :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- basic statistical concepts and techniques, including measures of central tendency, measures of variability, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.

<b>7. Machine Learning</b> :brain:
- basics of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, classification, regression, and clustering.

<b>8. Fun Projects</b> :tada:
- various code snippets that were created and collected here along the way
