<h1> Logical and Comparison Operators </h1>

In this exercise I will be using **Logical and Comparison Operators** to showcase comparing data in different contexts.

<h2> Logical Operators </h2>
Logical operators in Python are used to evaluate the truth or falsehood of expressions, often used in conditional statements and loops. There are three main logical operators:

- <code>and</code>: returns **True** if both expressions are true. Example: <code>x > 5 and x < 10</code>

- <code>or</code>: returns **True** if either expression is true. Example: <code>x == 5 or x == 10</code>

- <code>not</code>: returns **the opposite** of the expression. Example: <code>not(x > 5 and x < 10)</code>
